This project contains the [VeloC sample heat distribution program](https://veloc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#example).  It is modified to include [Kokkos](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/wiki) functionality to measure performance. 

Also included is a script (master.sh) that is used to create a batch file.  The batch script acts as a do-while loop and runs the sample program
until it exits cleanly.

CMake build instructions are not currently included, but will be added soon.
